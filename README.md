# customer-churn

Customer churn in simple words is predicting that which customers are at high risk of leaving the company.
If a customer is cancelling or ending subscription with a company or an organisation, it will be also considered as customer churn.

In mathematical terms, customer churn is the number of customer lost during a specific period divided by the number of customers at the beginning of that period.
For example, If a company had 100 subscribers at the beginning of a Quarter and lost 30 of them in that period, then the churn rate would be 30%.

In order to predict this, we have made a deep learning model and have used ANN to predict the churn. This model has 86% accuracy. 

Firstly, the data was installed from kaggle.
Secondly, the data was cleaned and the data that was not required for the purpose of prediction was neglected. 
Thirdly, splitting of test data and train data was done.
